## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your environment and run the code:

### Clone the Repository
To begin, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fatemeh-Farnaghizadeh/SwinTransformer_TransferLearning_for_classification.git
cd SwinTransformer_TransferLearning_for_classification
```
### Download Dataset
You will need to download the flower dataset to train and test your model. You can obtain the dataset from this [link]().

### Set Up Virtual Environment
To ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies and avoid conflicts with your system-wide Python packages, it's recommended to create a Python virtual environment. Follow these steps:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Run the Code
You can now execute all the code.

## Results
You can find the predictions of the trained model on the test dataset in the test_result.csv file.
